										<h3>Why I chose RMIT</h3>
										<p>I initially didn’t choose RMIT for any special reason, it was simply the fact that RMIT is considered as a moderately well-established university and the location in contrast of other universities was somewhat convenient. </p>

What makes this position appealing to me is that a System administrator is held accountable to ensure an organisation’s computer systems are well sustained and function appropriately. </p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p>My Project idea consists of making an application that will allow RMIT students to view their classes and how to get to their location. Hence this application will be the combination of using timetables and navigation tools. The user will also have other functions such as seeing the inside of RMIT buildings which will allow students to find their way around, adding friends to see their friends’ timetables and their class locations. (will have the ability to disable if chosen) and live updates being whether or not a class has been cancelled, rescheduled or possibly just moved to another location.</p>
