								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>My Project idea consists of making an application that will allow RMIT students to view their classes and how to get to their location. Hence this application will be the combination of using timetables and navigation tools. The user will also have other functions such as seeing the inside of RMIT buildings which will allow students to find their way around, adding friends to see their friends’ timetables and their class locations. (will have the ability to disable if chosen) and live updates being whether or not a class has been cancelled, rescheduled or possibly just moved to another location. </p>
								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>This project will be useful mainly in two instances. Initially when new students arrive to RMIT they will find it difficult to find their way around as RMIT unlike other universities doesn’t have one set location it varies from building to building which are spread around the city (referring to city campus). Hence if the creation of this application is successful this issue should be negated majorly. The other instance being when a new semester begins and students who have studied at RMIT previously may not know the locations of their new classes, hence the application will also help them.</p>
								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>The timetable function will be simply generic, meaning it will display all seven days in a grid format displaying the time possibly 1am -11pm and the designated classes within their set time periods, the user will be able to select (click) the class and a pop up will open stating all the important information about the class such as the latest announcements posted by the lecture or tutor for that class, the location (Building, Level and Room), friends that are also in that same class as you and directions to that selected class. If the user, then proceeds to select for directions a map from their current location to their designated location will appear and the user will then be guided to their class. Users will be allowed to add individuals who also have the app, this will be done through a username system of which users can enter people’s usernames, after the respondent accepts the request the two will be able to view one another’s timetable this will allow users to organise time of which they would like to meet up for a class or simply just to know when one another is free. Once users arrive to their class’s building they will then have the ability to view a map of the inside of the building, the point of this function is for users to know how to locate not only their building but also how to navigate inside the building as it is a common misconception that once you arrive to your location you will know how to easily locate your class. The user will be able to select the level of their class and then will be displayed a floor map of that entire floor, this will allow them to locate their class. The application will also have a notification system which informs the user if their class has been cancelled, rescheduled or swapped to another location, the point of this is so students aren’t accidently going to classes that are no longer running or if their initial location was changed. Hence based on all the explained functions the service will be allowing all RMIT student’s who have a internet connection to have the ability to view their classes times, locations and other important information, view their friend’s class’s to determine when they are potentially free and to allow for the ability for student’s to receive direction’s via the application from their current location to their designated location, with this function all user’s should be able to find their around all RMIT building’s since they will also have the ability to view inside floor plans. With all of these functions all users should and will be able to find all their classes and be able to pre plan how they will get to their classes ensuring that majority of new student’s will not be late to their classes as they are being essentially explained on how to arrive to their classes lectures and other university events.</p>
								<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
								<p>The plan is for the application to be compatible on both Samsung and Apple hardware and products as they are the most popular brands for smart phones meaning having both the application on both devices we will be able to cover a larger variety of students. For creating the application, I believe that I will be using MIT app Inventor as it is can be used to create smartphone applications. It is possible that other developing apps may be used if MIT app inventor doesn’t suit the needs of the application as we would want the best developing tools available.</p>
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<p>Communication skills are a necessity as this project will be done in groups, hence if an induvial lacks this ability they may find it difficult to communicate to other members of the group. The basic understanding of how to code will also be important as we will be using a development tool to create the application while having a good understanding of how to use a development tool would also be beneficial as this will quicken the pace of the development of the application as a whole. Hence any knowledge of coding will be an overall benefit to the project.</p>
								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p>If the outcome is successful, then students new or old will know how to get to their classes, meaning that a majority of student’s will not be late as they can pre plan how to arrive at their classes building, level and room through both the directions function and the ability to view floor maps of buildings. Hence the original problem will be solved being that the majority of users who use the application and the impact would be that students won’t be late to future classes or lectures meaning the overall creation of the application would be a success. </p>
