								<h2>What is my intrest in IT</h2>
								<p>I’ve been around technology my entire life, hence my Interest in IT began when I was extremely young. There wasn’t particularly an event or an individual that sparked that interest however a constant involvement through playing video games most likely contributed to it. Hence it was something that was formed over time as a result of always being around technology. </p>
								<p>My main IT experience began in 2017, (year 11) This was the first time I had taken any IT classes. The first class was computer studies, in this class I learnt the basic concepts of Coding in Java and a basic understanding of databases and also about networking which included cloud computing. While in my second class which was a VET subject called VCE VET information, digital media and technology in which I learnt the knowledge and confidence to work in the parts of information technology in a variety of industry areas. Organisational and professional activity skills including some management skills. Through this experience in year 11 I decided that the following year I would continue my studies in Information technology by enrolling in software development. In year 12 I took the class Software Development which I used my knowledge from the previous year to understand more challenging concepts and find ways to overcome them. </p>
								<h2>Why I chose RMIT</h2>
								<p>I initially didn’t choose RMIT for any special reason, it was simply the fact that RMIT is considered as a moderately well-established university and the location in contrast of other universities was somewhat convenient. I’d also been somewhat familiarised of how RMIT works as the secondary school I had gone to provided students a day where we went to RMIT and where displayed some of their facilities. However, when I further researched into universities, I quickly realised that RMIT’s IT degrees are considered as one of the best that Melbourne has to offer, hence it was clear that I should strive to choose RMIT as one of my leading preferences for university selections. </p>
								<h2>What I expect to learn</h2>
								<p>I expect to learn the intended skills of which can be implemented in a variety of jobs which are considered to be under the Information technology umbrella. However, skills of which can be beneficial for working as a System administrator are as follows, the knowledge of implementing and configuring and troubleshooting datab111ase instances, setting up user privileges within a database environment, monitoring and optimizing system performances using index tuning and other methods and Installing, configuring and troubleshooting to maintain a database system. Hopefully with learning theses basic concepts and other ideas I will be more then capable of working as a system administrator. </p>
