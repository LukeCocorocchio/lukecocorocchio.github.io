								<h2>Description of position</h2>
								<p>What makes this position appealing to me is since that a System administrator is held accountable to ensure that an organisation’s computer systems are well sustained and function appropriately. Objectives to be completed by system administrators contains tasks such as carrying out consistent system and security observations, conducting backup procedures and participating in set up, maintaining and deleting user accounts as required. Hence, I find this position appealing as I believe that the responsibilities that are given to a System administrator could be challenging which ultimately makes me believe that this job could be enjoyable as I appreciate being required to overcome a challenge and to do that as a job of which I am getting paid would be exhilarating. </p>
								<h2>Skills qualifications and experience required</h2>
								<p>Education and the designated experience required to work as a System administrator ultimately varies depending on the organisation of which you are potentially employed for. Although, the common requirement is stated to be a bachelor’s degree in an IT field for example (Information Technology, Computer Science etc.) Some applicable experience is usually beneficial to have as employers would be more inclined to hire someone with experience over someone who doesn’t. Skills that are required to work as a system administrator includes, ensuring an organisation’s computer systems are well sustained and function appropriately. Objectives that are to be completed by system administrators consists of tasks such as carrying out consistent system and security observations, conducting backup procedures and participating in set up and to maintain and delete user accounts as required.   </p>
								<h2>Skills and qualifications I currently have</h2>
								<p>Unfortunately, I currently don’t have any sufficient experience, as I’m still studying at university and will remain the same until I complete my course. However, this could possibly change if I were to be offered an internship. Regarding the knowledge required to partake in this job, I’m also not inept for that, this should change however once I come close to or at the completion of my degree or perhaps possibly partake in higher education (master’s degree). Potential qualifications that I have a basic understanding of which can possibly be implemented into working as a system administrator includes, Installing and configuring hardware, software and Troubleshooting and reporting basic violations.  </p>
                <h2>My Plan</h2>
                <p>I presume that through completing my degree I will gain the necessary skills in-order to apply and work as a Systems Administrator, however if this is not the case then I may possibly continue to study and possibly achieve a master’s degree. However, through studying and learning the basics skills of which a system administrator is required to know which includes implementing and configuring and troubleshooting database instances, setting up user privileges within a database environment, monitoring and optimizing system performances using index tuning and other methods and Installing, configuring and troubleshooting to maintain a database system. Hopefully with learning theses basic concepts and other ideas I will be more then capable of working as a system administrator.    </p>
